      <description>When it comes to reviewing code that does any kind of file IO, there are a number of patterns that I find myself discouraging quite often. Interestingly, I have found that these patterns are rarely considered in discussions around code review and clean code.
In this post, I will explore some of these patterns in more depth, and discuss why I believe it&amp;rsquo;s worth taking the time to do things slightly differently in many cases.</description>
