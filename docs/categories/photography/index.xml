      <description>Back to post 1
The first post in this series was rather destructive. The floor was torn out, and the deck trim was prised off. This post is more constructive, and covers the first few steps of building a new floor.
Fortunately, it was possible to save enough of the original floor to use as a template. Working in this way was much simpler than trying to measure out the awkwardly curved inner profile of the hull!</description>

      <description>The boat is a Hanseatic 19.2, which appears to have been built in 1978. The cockpit had clearly been re-fitted at some time during this period; with a thick, planked deck, a center mainsheet (awkwardly) attached to the floor on a short wire cable, and a bilge pump handle located directly in the middle of the floor. From the looks of the boat, and some judicious Googling, it appears that the mainsheet may have originally been attached at the transom, though this practice appears to have fallen out of fashion on more modern boats.</description>

      <description>Abisso Chimera 2011 (trip report) Written as a trip report for the UBSS newsletter – Text in italics is my (attempt!) at translating Florence Ménétrier’s trip report into English. Participants: Fred, Ross, Flo for the Sophitaupes, the Faverjons (Marc, Anne et Maud) and five other Italians. This trip to Abisso Chimera (at 1006m, it is currently the 85th deepest cave in the world) was completed in October 2011.
I found myself in the sad position of having finished my degree last year, and not feeling particularly keen on entering the world of work, I somehow managed to install myself in a Ph.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I posted to say that I had been sent a travel espresso machine by Handpresso and that I had the intention of taking it on expedition. Well I have now returned and despite several bouts of torrential rain, a path to base camp that was muddy enough to absorb an entire man and a herd of voracious cows that ate their way through an array of hiking clothes, I am pleased to report that the coffee available was second to none.</description>
