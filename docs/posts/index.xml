      <description>I have started trying to avoid the word &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; in the workplace. Admittedly, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a silly idea, but I do think it&amp;rsquo;s a worthwhile adjustment that can help improve our professional relationships.
This little word can pop up quite a lot, &amp;ldquo;Jane owns this project&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I own this document&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Pete can you own this?&amp;rdquo;. It feels innocent enough, but I would argue that it can nudge our mindset in the wrong direction in the workplace.</description>

      <description>When it comes to reviewing code that does any kind of file IO, there are a number of patterns that I find myself discouraging quite often. Interestingly, I have found that these patterns are rarely considered in discussions around code review and clean code.
In this post, I will explore some of these patterns in more depth, and discuss why I believe it&amp;rsquo;s worth taking the time to do things slightly differently in many cases.</description>

      <description>Abisso Chimera 2011 (trip report) Written as a trip report for the UBSS newsletter – Text in italics is my (attempt!) at translating Florence Ménétrier’s trip report into English. Participants: Fred, Ross, Flo for the Sophitaupes, the Faverjons (Marc, Anne et Maud) and five other Italians. This trip to Abisso Chimera (at 1006m, it is currently the 85th deepest cave in the world) was completed in October 2011.
I found myself in the sad position of having finished my degree last year, and not feeling particularly keen on entering the world of work, I somehow managed to install myself in a Ph.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I posted to say that I had been sent a travel espresso machine by Handpresso and that I had the intention of taking it on expedition. Well I have now returned and despite several bouts of torrential rain, a path to base camp that was muddy enough to absorb an entire man and a herd of voracious cows that ate their way through an array of hiking clothes, I am pleased to report that the coffee available was second to none.</description>
