Starting the the floor The first post in this series was rather destructive. The floor was torn out, and the deck trim was prised off. This post is more constructive, and covers the first few steps of building a new floor.
Fortunately, it was possible to save enough of the original floor to use as a template. Working in this way was much simpler than trying to measure out the awkwardly curved inner profile of the hull!</description>

      <description>First Steps In order to keep myself busy whilst locked down, I took on a project of restoring a rather dilapidated, though (in my opinion) charming, and pleasingly-proportioned keelboat. The boat was complete with both a mainsail and a jib and, despite being quite scruffy, actually was sailable. Despite this, the general condition of the boat was quite bad, and it was unlikely to deal well with strong gusts&amp;hellip;
The boat is a Hanseatic 19.</description>
